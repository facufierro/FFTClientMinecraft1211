Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\n**📘 The official documentation is available at [sinytra.org](https://sinytra.org/docs).**\n\nThe Forgified Fabric API (FFAPI) is a direct port of [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) for the NeoForge\nmodloader, regularly kept up to date with the upstream repository. It is designed to make cross platform mod development\neasier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the game's code on both platforms.\nHowever, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each\nplatform.\n\n### 💬 Join the Community\n\nWe have an official [Discord community](https://discord.gg/mamk7z3TKZ) for our projects. By joining, you can:\n\n- Get help and technical support from our team and community members\n- Keep in touch with the latest development updates and community events\n- Engage in the project's development and collaborate with our team\n- ... and just hang out with the rest of our community.",

Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving\ndevelopers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play\nall their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to NeoForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install NeoForge. We recommend using the latest stable version.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.\n\nPlease note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while also getting you a fixed version ASAP.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nSinytra Connector is, and will always remain, licensed under the MIT license.

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n### Video tutorial for 1.19.2\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/dBW4qrS.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJJbNJjics)\n\nCan I reload scripts?\n---------------------\n\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\nI don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod!\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\nI have a question / suggestion / bug report!\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can ask questions, make feature suggestions and report bugs here: [KubeJS Support](https://kubejs.com/support)\n\n[![](https://links.latvian.dev/links.png?mr=kubejs)](https://links.latvian.dev/)\n\n[![](https://links.latvian.dev/partner.png)](https://links.latvian.dev/partner)",

          "body": "### Short introduction\n\nMod replaces silly wooden tools and tree punching with more reasonable options. \n\nYou heard this before. There are small mods that add flint tools and maybe grass fiber; there are large mods like MITE that completely change the game. And I liked none of them.\n\nI wanted a more believable early game. I wanted more difficult but still satisfying early game. Since no modder did it right, here we are...\n\n![showcase](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/548/679/mod_icon.png)\n\n### How to play\n\nFirst part of the pre-stone phase - getting wood - is easy. Find some flint in gravel piles, get some sticks, make a flint hatchet. Easy.\n\nSecond part - getting cobblestone - is going to be a challenge (unless you turn off challenge in options). Make a wall from fences or food old dirt blocks because this might take a day or two. And start a small farm (wooden hoe still works). Luckily, this mod provides a simple firepit and flint javelins. Make a few javelins (three or four a recommended and meet the first night with steely resolve in your eyes and flimsy javelins in your hands!\n\n \n### Vision and history\n\nAlthough first published for 1.18, this mod is far older but author tends to get to 97% and then stop. And pretty-much finished mod lives in his mod folder.\n\nIt was partly inspired by \"minecraft is too easy\", where there was a clear pre-stone phase of the game. That is what I wanted to capture. But only that; there are no more similarities with MITE because its author Avernite is apparently a sadist.\n\n \nI am not a sadist. I can make the start more difficult, I can make you worry about food and shelter, but I want you to get out of all that victoriously - proud of yourself and, perchance, a tad thankful to me for making this.\n\n \n\n### Related mods\n\nThe idea is that I make a bunch of tiny mods and that you pick what you like. I hate large mods like MITE - they take control of entire game. I will focus on small parts and try not to bother the player when they are not doing the thing the mod is about. For some reason many modders can't seem to do that.\n \n\nFirst one you should look into is [Cook your food](https://modrinth.com/mod/cook-your-food) - tiny mod that pushes players to cook their food or suffer negative effects.\n",

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Features\n\nYACL has a ton of configuration features:\n\n- Custom control widgets\n  - Create your own unique \"controller\" if the default set does not suit your needs\n- Rich descriptions\n  - Clickable & hoverable text, powered by vanilla's Text component system\n  - WebP (including animated) image previews\n  - Custom rich-renderable section to replace image\n- Multiple controllers for the same type:\n  - Sliders or fields for numbers\n  - Dropdowns, cyclers, or raw text fields for strings\n  - Tickboxes or ON/OFF text display for booleans\n  - ...and more!\n- Fully-featured color picker\n- Accessible with full compatibility for keyboard control (optimised for Controlify usage)\n- High organisation with tabs (categories) and collapsable groups\n- Built-in serialization/deserialization techniques so you can skip the error-prone config code\n- Full alternative Kotlin DSL\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![image preview](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/images/5862570281f5109119c11f21a1bba52b6a2ab17f.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n",

With McQoy, you can! Just drop the mod in and you're set.\n\n### I DON'T NEED A DOCTOR, I AM A DOCTOR\n\nTo set this up for your own mod, check out [Kaleido#usage](https://github.com/sisby-folk/kaleido-config#usage) - any loader and version, doesn't matter, it's universal.<br/>\nWhen setting the config up, just make sure to specify your folder _or_ filename as your mod ID, so McQoy can find it.\n\n<center><img alt=\"qconfig example\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNmWwdI2/images/2b36d05c06cc8c9dcf11b2b22d66c607c2d80e6e.png\"/></center>\n<center><i>You may find this arrangement terribly pleasant.</i></center><br/>\n\nThen, on any McQoy-compatible version, installing McQoy will add screens! No setup, and no hard dependency.<br/>\nFor player visibility, you can also set McQoy as an `optional` dependency on Modrinth. (Or `required`, I'm not a cop.)\n\n## IF I'M NOT CAREFUL, I'LL END UP TALKING TO MYSELF\n\nOh, right - a little background and credit is due:\n\n### ALL I GOT LEFT IS MY BONES\n\n[Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config) isn't built on quilt, or even minecraft - It's a _pure-java_ configuration library.\n\nThat means it works on every loader, and every version of minecraft, with no changes required.\n\nThe API is even designed for mods like McQoy to utilize - with fancy annotation-based metadata. Thanks qconf!\n\n### I'M NOT A MAGICIAN, SPOCK\n\nKaleido is just a wrapper for Quilt Config that shadows the library to avoid path conflicts with Quilt Loader.\n\nWith quilt seemingly being sunset, we'll be sure to follow the maintainers if they decide to fork it (hi ix!)\n\n## FASCINATING\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThis project is based on [Quilt Config](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-config) - and exists only because it's a genuinely great pure-java config library. \n\n**Special thanks to [ix0rai](https://modrinth.com/user/ix0rai) and [cassiancc](https://github.com/cassiancc)** for providing helpful code snippets and having good ideas to begin with.\n\n\n",

You shouldn't need to download it alone.*\n\n#### Commands\n\n* `/surveyor` - display information about your map exploration, including sharing.\n* `/surveyor share [username]` - request/accept sharing map exploration with a player.\n* `/surveyor unshare` - stop sharing map exploration (leave your \"sharing group\")\n* `/surveyor landmarks` - view a cross-world landmark breakdown by type.\n* `/surveyor landmarks get [type]` - lists each landmark of that type in the current world.\n* `/surveyor landmarks remove [type] [pos]` removes a waypoint or landmark (op 2) from the world.\n* `/surveyor landmarks add [type] [pos] [name]` add a waypoint to the world at the specified position.\n* `/surveyor landmarks global [type] [pos] [name]` (op 2) add a landmark to the world at the specified position.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nSurveyor has extensive start-time configuration in `config/surveyor.toml`.<br/>\nIt's various systems can be turned on and off, and map sharing tweaked finely.\n\n---\n\n### Library Features\n\n**Surveyor relieves the scanning, saving, and networking responsibilities from dependent map mods.**\n\nIn general, Surveyor:\n\n* Records terrain, structure, and \"landmark\" data suitable for maps as the world is changed.\n* Enables live map sharing between players by tracking individual exploration of the map.\n* Sends the client structures as they're discovered or shared.\n* Syncs map data and landmarks (e.g. waypoints) when sharing or on client data loss.\n* Exposes a generic API for map mod integrations (e.g. adding map markers to important locations).\n* Only adds 2-5% to save size, using an efficient format both in-memory and on-disk.\n\nSurveyor's data **deliberately preserves key details**, designed to allow any abitrary map mod to use it:\n\n* Terrain is a top-down view of blocks with height, biome, light level, and water depth.\n* Terrain contains multiple layers, allowing for usable cave and nether maps.\n* Structures have IDs, pieces, tags, and even full piece NBT for smaller structures intact.\n* Landmarks generically represent other positional map data - e.g. waypoints, POIs, or faction claims.\n\n---\n\n**Notice: Surveyor is still in early releases.**\n\n* The API might break several times during 0.x\n* The networking format will break several times during 0.x.\n* The save format will likely break on the change to 1.x\n* Javadoc is very limited\n\n---\n\n## Developers\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n\tmaven { url 'https://repo.sleeping.town/' }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\tmodImplementation 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n\tinclude 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n}\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\n* **[Antique Atlas 4](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas)** - A stylized client-side map mod.\n* **[SurveyorSurveyor](https://github.com/HestiMae/surveyor-surveyor)** - An enhanced-vanilla style java map image generator, using raw surveyor save files.\n* **[Surveystones](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-fwaystones)** - A mixed-side addon that automatically adds landmarks for waystones from [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones/versions).\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nThe **World Summary** holds all of surveyor's data for a world. It can be accessed using `WorldSummary.of(World)`.\n\n**Chunk Summaries** (or the \"Terrain Summary\") represent the world viewed from above. This includes the top layer of blocks, along with their biome, height, block light level, and the depth of water above them.\n\n**Structure Summaries** represent an in-world structure (called `StructureStart` in yarn) - they include map-critical information for identifying the structure and its pieces, even full NBT for structures with under 10 pieces, but not any actual blocks.\n\n**Landmarks** are a way to represent all other positional information on-map. They have unique serialization per-type, and are uniquely keyed by their type and position to prevent overlaps.\n\n**Exploration** is a record of what chunks, structures, and landmarks a player should be able to see.<br/>\nA player explores a chunk when they're sent it, explores a structure when they stand in (or look at) one of its pieces, and explores an (unowned) landmark when they explore the chunk it's in.\n\n### Terrain Summary Layers\n\nTo facilitate cave mapping, Surveyor records the top layer of blocks at **multiple height levels** (layer heights).\n\n**The Overworld** scans for floors in these layers:\n\n* 257-319 - usually empty\n* 62-256 - surface terrain\n* 0-61 - sea floors and riverbeds, ravines, and caves\n* -64-0 - deepslate caves\n\n**The Nether** scans for floors in these layers:\n\n* 127-255 - usually flat bedrock\n* 71-126 - high caves and outcrops\n* 41-70 - mid-level outcrops and walkways\n* 0-40 - the lava sea and shores\n\nRoughly speaking, Surveyor will accept any non-clear solid block below a 2-high walk-space as a floor.<br/>\nIt will also detect \"carpets\" (non-clear non-solid blocks) above these floors and use those instead.\n\nSurveyor supports any layer height configuration, but currently lacks the API/config to change this for specific dimensions.\n\nNote that the amount of layers doesn't affect how mods display the map, only how often cave floors will be occluded by floors above them.\n\n### Map Mods\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the map mod guide</summary>\n\nQuick reminder that surveyor should **replace any existing world scanning logic**<br/>\nYou should never need to look at the currently loaded chunks - If some information is missing, let us know!\n\n#### Initial Setup\n\nClient map mods should always use `SurveyorClientEvents` - this ensures only explored areas will be provided in singleplayer.\n\nTune into `WorldLoad` and queue up the provided keys for rendering.<br/>\nThis event will trigger when the client world has access to surveyor data and the player is available.\n\n`terrain` contains all available chunks by region. `WorldTerrainSummary.toKeys()` converts this into ChunkPos.<br/>\n`structures` contains all structure starts by key + ChunkPos.<br/>\n`landmarks` contains all landmarks (POIs, waypoints, death markers, etc.) by type + BlockPos.\n\nYou can get these from the world summary later using `keySet()` methods - check the event implementation.<br/>\nPass in `SurveyorClient.getExploration()` to ensure unexplored areas are hidden.\n\n##### Live Updates\n\nAlso tune into `TerrainUpdated`, `StructuresAdded`, `LandmarksAdded` to add to your render queues.<br/>\nThese fire whenever the client player should see something new (usually via exploration).<br/>\nThey can also fire before `ClientPlayerLoad`, so let any of them create your map data.\n\nTune into `LandmarksRemoved` as well but without a queue - just remove from your map/queue directly.\n\n#### Terrain Rendering\n\nFirst, generate a top layer (with any desired height limits) using `get(ChunkPos).toSingleLayer()`.<br/>\nThis will produce a raw layer summary of one-dimensional arrays:\n\n* **exists** - True where a floor exists, false otherwise - where false, all other fields are junk.\n* **depths** - The distance of the floor below your specified world height. so y = worldHeight - depth.\n* **blocks** - The floor block. Indexed per-region via `getBlockPalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **biomes** - The floor biome. Indexed per-region via `getBiomePalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **lightLevels** - The block light level directly above the floor (i.e. the block light for its top face). 0-15.\n* **waterLights** - The block light level directly above the water's surface (if there is one). 0-15.\n* **waterDepths** - How deep the contiguous water above the floor is.\n\t* All other liquid surfaces are considered floors, but water is special-cased.\n\t* The sea floor (e.g. sand) is recorded, and this depth value indicates the water surface instead.\n\t* This allows maps to show water depth shading, but also hide water completely if desired.\n\nAll arrays can be indexed by `x * 16 + z`, where x and z are relative to the chunk.<br/>\nUse these arrays to render and store map data for that chunk (pixels, buffers, whichever).<br/>\nRemember that you'll be rendering hundreds of thousands of chunks here - optimize this process hard.\n\n#### Structure Rendering\n\nAlong with the key and ChunkPos, you can get the type and any tags using `getType(key)` and `getTags(key)`.\n\nYou can access a full summary of the structure (e.g. to draw its bounding boxes) using `get(key, ChunkPos)`.<br/>\nThis includes piece data like boxes, direction, IDs, etc.\n\n#### Landmark Rendering & Management\n\nAlong with the type and BlockPos, you can get a full landmark using `get(type, BlockPos)`.\n\nBy default, this can include a dye color, a text name, the owner's UUID, and a texture (could be from another map mod).<br/>\nYou should have a method of rendering a landmark using just this information.\n\nTo improve how landmarks are displayed, you can use `instanceof` to check for additional data, e.g. `HasBlockBox`.\n\nTo add a waypoint landmark, just make a `SimplePointLandmark` owned by the player and use `put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis will save to disk and send a copy to the server.\n\n#### Player Rendering\n\nYou can use `SurveyorClient.getFriends()` to get a set of players to draw on the map.\n\nThis includes both the client player, online \"friends\" (map sharing group members), and offline friends.\n\nThe players are represented abstractly, providing UUID, username, global position, yaw, and online status.\n\n</details>\n\n### Landmark Integrations\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the landmark integration guide</summary>\n\nLandmark types can be registered via the registry in `Landmarks`.<br/>\nThis allows you to set and serialize custom data relevant to your landmark.<br/>\nYour landmark can usually be a record. Check the [builtins](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor/tree/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/surveyor/landmark) for an example.\n\nTo make extra landmark data accessible to map mods, always declare a new `Has` interface to access it from.\n\nTo place a landmark, just use `WorldSummary.of(world).landmarks().put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis works fine on either side - adding a landmark on the server will send it to the client and vice-versa.\n\nLandmark types can't yet have fallback types - so use a simple type (or PR a new one!) if your mod is only on one side.\n\n</details>\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\n**Special thanks to:**<br/>\n[Ampflower](https://github.com/Ampflower), [Falkreon](https://github.com/falkreon), [Garden](https://modrinth.com/user/GardenSystem), [Kat](https://git.sleeping.town/Kat), [Solo](https://github.com/solonovamax), [Crosby](https://github.com/RacoonDog), [Lemma](https://github.com/LemmaEOF), [Leo](https://github.com/leo60228), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jaskarth), [Aqua](https://github.com/Aquaeyes), [Wonder](https://git.sleeping.town/wonder), [Infinidoge](https://github.com/Infinidoge), [Emi](https://github.com/emilyploszaj), and [Una](https://github.com/unascribed).\n\nWe're open to better ways to implement our mods.

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/CREDITS) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to better ways to implement our mods. If you see something odd and have an idea, let us know!\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing\">Smithing</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus\">Origins</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures\">Statures</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud\">HUD</a><br/>\n<b>Loveletters:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-tabs\">Tabs</a> - <i>Atlas</i> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting\">Portable Crafting</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/drogstyle\">Drogstyle</a><br/>\n<b>Others:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy\">Switchy</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements\">Crunchy</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/starcaller\">Starcaller</a><br/>\n</center>\n",

Once in the player's inventory, it can be opened with the usual Antique Atlas hotkey or by right clicking while holding the item. When held, the map will also be visible.\n\nSharing and exploration progress is still handled by [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) and will continue even if the item is not present. **For instructions on how to share exploration progress, check its mod page.**\n\nThe atlas sprite is derived in good faith from the original [Antique Atlas](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas)\nand was drawn by Hunternif.",

Inspired by mods like Treecapitator.\n\n#### Cool features:\n- Doesn't get too loud when breaking big trees\n- Works on mushrooms and fungi\n- Intelligently breaks leaves\n- Compatible with most modded trees\n\n#### Things to consider when lumberjacking:\n- Chopping trees doesn't require an axe, but will take a while without one\n- Chopping different blocks of the same tree will all contribute to bringing down the tree\n- Players can work together to chop down those big trees\n- Bigger trees require more total chops, but fewer chops per block*\n- Hold \"sneak\" when breaking a log block to break it normally\n\n_*By default, the number of chops required to fell a tree is computed logarithmically. Some example numbers are below. The number of chops can also be configured to scale linearly with the number of blocks to, for example, require one chop per block, or one chop per tree. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop#configuring-chop-counting-version-0130-and-later)._\n\n| Tree blocks |  Chops required |\n| ------------ | ---------------- |\n| 1  | 1 |\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 5 | 4 |\n| 10 | 7 |\n| 20 | 12 |\n| 50 | 19 |\n|100 | 25 |\n\n<details><summary>Compatibility:</summary>\n\n#### Special support for the following mods:\n- (1.18.2) [Tinker's Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct): broad axes perform extra chops. All axes perform more chops with \"expanded\" upgrades.\n- (1.18.2+) Silent Gear: saws perform extra chops\n- (1.18.2+) [Project MMO](https://modrinth.com/mod/project-mmo): chopping grants woodcutting XP\n- (1.18.2+) [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade), [WTHIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit), [TheOneProbe](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-one-probe): show number of log blocks in trees and the number of chops needed to fell.\n\n#### Known issues:\n- (1.18.2 and earlier) Multi Mine: choppable blocks need to be added to Multi Mine's blacklist. This should be fixed for 1.19+ versions. See [#106](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/106).\n- Some modded trees leave floating blocks when felled. See [#44](https://github.com/hammertater/treechop/issues/44).\n\n_Want to make your mod compatible with TreeChop?

How do I turn off chopping?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"chopping\" setting. A key can also be bound to toggle chopping without opening the settings screen; go to Options > Controls and find the section labeled \"HT's TreeChop\".\n\n#### 2. How do I keep chopping off and only turn it on while sneaking?\nBy default, sneaking inverts your current chop setting, so just toggle chopping off (press n to access the settings screen) so that chopping will be enabled by sneaking.\n\n#### 3. How do I keep chopping even when sneaking?\nPress n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle off the \"Sneaking inverts chopping\" setting.\n\n#### 4. How do I keep from chopping my house down?\nThere's a setting to disable chopping if the \"tree\" is not connected to leaves. Press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle \"trees must have leaves\".\n\n#### 5. I started chopping my house down. How do I stop?\nIf you find yourself chopping a block when you just wanted to break it normally, try breaking the block while sneaking, or toggle off chopping (press n to access the settings screen).\n\n#### 6. I was chopping something and the game crashed! What's up with that?\nProbably the item you used to chop the tree doesn't play nice with TreeChop. Go to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and add the item's registry name to choppingToolsBlacklist, or ask the server owner to, and then maybe let me know about the conflict and I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 7. Why can't I chop anymore?\nMaybe chopping is turned off; press n to open TreeChop's in-game settings, then toggle on the \"chopping\" setting. If chopping is enabled and changing tools doesn't help, then there might be a conflict with another mod. If you send me a recent log, I'll try to fix it.\n\n#### 8. Why do some trees leave behind floating leaves when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and its leaves are not set up properly. Let me know what type of tree is misbehaving, and I'll politely inform the mod owners.\nb) there are too many leaves! You can increase the max number of leaves by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxLeavesBlocks.\n\n#### 9. Why do some trees leave behind floating logs when felled?\nEither\na) it's a modded tree and is weirdly shaped. Let me know, and I'll try to make TreeChop do a better job of detecting that type of tree.\nb) the tree is too big! You can increase the max tree size by going to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and increasing maxTreeBlocks.\n\n#### 10. How do I disable mushroom and fungus chopping?\nGo to [your minecraft folder]/config/treechop-common.toml and change\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables\"\nto\n    blockTagForDetectingLogs = \"treechop:choppables_except_mushrooms\"\nIf you want more control over which blocks can be chopped, you have to make your own datapack and fiddle with the block tags (see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag for more info).\n\n#### 12. Why am I not seeing the [fill in the blank] feature?\nOnly the newest version of Minecraft 1.16 is fully supported. Some older versions, especially 1.12.2, lack some of the fancier features.\n\n#### 11. Can I include this in a modpack?\nYes!\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sample configs:</summary>\n\n<details><summary>treechop-common.toml</summary>\n\n```toml\n[permissions]\n\n\t[permissions.choppingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.fellingEnabled]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.sneakBehavior]\n\t\tcanBeNone = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertFelling = true\n\t\tcanBeInvertChopping = true\n\n\t[permissions.treeMustHaveLeaves]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n\t[permissions.chopInCreativeMode]\n\t\tcanBeFalse = true\n\t\tcanBeTrue = true\n\n[general]\n\t#If false, log items will be destroyed when chopping\n\tdropLootForChoppedBlocks = true\n\n[treeDetection]\n\t#Maximum number of log blocks that can be detected to belong to one tree\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxTreeBlocks = 320\n\t#Maximum number of leaves blocks that can destroyed when a tree is felled\n\t#Range: 1 ~ 8096\n\tmaxLeavesBlocks = 1024\n\t#Destroy leaves when a tree is felled\n\tbreakLeaves = true\n\t#Non-decayable leaves are ignored when detecting leaves\n\tignorePersistentLeaves = true\n\t#Maximum distance from log blocks to destroy non-standard leaves blocks (e.g. mushroom caps) when felling\n\t#Range: 0 ~ 16\n\tmaxBreakLeavesDistance = 7\n\n\t[treeDetection.logs]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered choppable\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:choppables\", \"#minecraft:logs\", \"#forge:mushroom_stems\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be chopped, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = [\"minecraft:bamboo\"]\n\n\t[treeDetection.leaves]\n\t\t#Blocks that should be considered leaves\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\tblocks = [\"#treechop:leaves_like\", \"#minecraft:leaves\", \"#minecraft:wart_blocks\", \"#forge:mushroom_caps\", \"minecraft:shroomlight\"]\n\t\t#Blocks that should never be considered leaves, even if included in the list above\n\t\t#Specify using registry names (mod:block), tags (#mod:tag), and namespaces (@mod)\n\t\texceptions = []\n\n[chopCounting]\n\t#Method to use for computing the number of chops needed to fell a tree\n\t#Allowed Values: LINEAR, LOGARITHMIC\n\talgorithm = \"LOGARITHMIC\"\n\t#How to round the number of chops needed to fell a tree;

          "description": "Target Dummy that show damage dealt and can be equipped with armor",
          "body": "\nThis is a small mod that adds exactly one item: a Target Dummy.\n\nThe dummy can be placed in the world, where it'll stand silently, judging your every action. It'll wiggle funny if you hit it, screaming large numbers of damage at you. It can be dressed up to look even more awesome. This will please the dummy, making the numbers smaller.\n\nTL;DR: target dummies show damage dealt to them and can be equipped with armor\n\n \n\nUsage:\nRight click on a block with a target dummy to place it. He can be rotated 16 different directions depending on the way you face when you place it, similar to an armor stand.\n\nYou can start dressing the little dude with all kind of armors and equipment. Just right click him with the desired item. To unequip a certain armor piece just click on his corresponding body part.\n\nGot tired of testing your dps? You can remove the dummy just by shift left clicking him with an empty hand!\n\n \n\nAdditional features:\nHave you ever wanted to test your new smite sword but couldn't because there are no skellies around? Well fear no more, you can now equip the dummy with and undead mob head and it will change its type accordingly!\nSimilarly you can equip him with a turtle helmet to make it a water mob or with a pillager banner to turn it into a pillager mob. Note that he still won't be attacked by other mobs (maybe it a future update), he'll just take more damage from appropriate enchantment and so on.\n\n \n\n Need automating? You can dispense the dummy using a dispenser and you can break him by removing the block under his feet.\n \n\n Don't like how much he swings or the new skin? Well you can easily change that by using the mod config file. You can additionally choose between static and dynamic dps messages and you can make the numbers show hearths instead of damage.\nTry shearing the dummies to get a different skin!\n\n \n\nYou can also equip them with a pumpkin or jack o lantern and they'll act as scarecrows, scaring nearby animals\n \n\n \n\nFull list of changes from original 1.12 bonusboni's mod:\n \n\nLots of stuff here, more than half of the mod was re written.\n\nNew skin!\nAdded support for more than one damage number. They now have a fading animation to clarify which is the newest.\nNumbers change their colors depending on the type of damage dealt. For example critical hits are red and lightning damage is yellow. Try it out!\nAdded dispenser support\nCan mimic mob types by equipping different items.\nUpdated the model and animation so that the head stays attached to the body\nThe dummy now reacts to all damage types\nCan be killed with /kill command, by withers and by void damage.\nDps number now appears on the status bar. You can choose between static and dynamic dps in the config.\nAdded configs to change a few aesthetic things\nEquipping and unequipping functions alot more like an armor stand\nBase is a bit smaller and centered on the block grid\nCustom armor models from other mods render properly (only 1.16 for now)\nSwinging animation is not much smoother\nAct as scarecrows when equipped with a pumpkin\nFixed some bugs\n",

          "body": "<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wqSocVR.png\">\n</p>\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, brand new **tools and weapons** to hunt and gather with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the Advancements!** They explain many of the basic concepts, and are a good place to start from.\n\nPick up any item, then press the **L** key (by default) to open the Advancements screen. Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)",

          "changelog": "## 1.2.8\n\n### Additions\n- New item tags:\n  - `#meals` - Groups bowl and plate foods which are considered a \"meal\" by the mod. Excludes Fruit Salad and Nether Salad;\n  - `#drinks` - Groups drinkable FD items that are not potions;\n  - `#feasts` - Groups the full forms of feasts. Their portions reside in `#meals`;\n\n### Updates\n- Wheat Dough now has a simpler, less cumbersome crafting recipe using a Water Bucket:\n  - Wheat can be crafted with a Water Bucket to make Dough. The bucket's water won't be depleted, letting you craft dough indefinitely;\n  - The bucket acts as a simple technology gate to unlock this recipe;\n  - The egg recipe is still present, to not break auto-crafting setups;\n- All usages of water buckets in the mod (recipes, interactions etc) now use a common tag (thanks, thelegitdolt!):\n  - 1.20.1: `forge:buckets/water` (unofficial);\n  - 1.21.1: `c:buckets/water`;\n- Added knives to the `breaks_decorated_pots` tag;\n- Updated integration with `create:upright_on_belt` to include all bowl, plate and bottle items;\n- Updated the Master Chef advancement with additional meals;\n  - The meals reflect the \"vanilla FD\" entries in the `meals` tag, but does not update with the tag itself;\n- Updated effect description IDs for all langs (thanks, mpustovoi!);\n- Cooking Pot will always \"cool down\" when the recipe becomes invalid mid-cooking, instead of losing all cooking progress in some circumstances;\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed Jack-O-Lantern not being mineable with a Knife;\n- Fixed Create's Potato Cannon integration;\n- Fixed Knives with Silk Touch slicing Pumpkin blocks;\n- Fixed budding bushes (Tomato)'s planting rules being hardcoded to vanilla farmland;\n- Fixed Rich Soil negating fall damage (1.21.1) and `turnToDirt` converting it into normal dirt (thanks, SarahIsWeird!);\n- (1.21.1) Fixed Baskets and Cabinets not having an item handler capability (thanks, RaymondBlaze!);\n- (1.21.1) Updated Create Integration to the newest update's syntax (thanks, mpustovoi!);\n- (1.21.1) Fixed `storage_blocks` tags not being nested in their parent (thanks, Lucky-56!);\n- (1.21.1) Fixed FD recipe ID's not being displayed on debug info on JEI screens (thanks, Abbie5!);\n- (1.21.1) Fixed Immersive Engineering integration recipes;\n- (1.21.1) Fixed Tall-mato advancement not working properly;\n- (1.21.1) Fixed HUD overlays rendering on top of AppleSkin overlays;\n\n### Translations\n- Updated:\n  - es_es (thanks, GGlangf!);\n  - zh_cn (thanks, NumberSir!);\n  - zh_tw (thanks, DEEMsss!);",

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work.

          "changelog": "A few adjustments to the AutoRegister API:  \n- Add various helper methods to the AutoRegisterEntityType.Builder, including for passenger attachment points. This mirrors vanilla behavior.  \n- Add getHolder() methods to AutoRegister MobEffect and Potion. Using these should help ensure smooth Potion registration without registry issues on Forge and NeoForge.  \n- AutoRegisterPotion now takes a Potion supplier to make it more consistent with other AutoRegister wrapper classes.  \n- AutoRegisterUtils.registerBrewingRecipe() now takes Holders as parameters instead of Suppliers.  \n  \nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!",

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it! Seriously!</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3LW5j7DAdE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMhFcqM.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better End Island is intended to be compatible with as many mods as possible. The following are compatibility notes for relevant End mods/datapacks:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Endergetic Expansion</b><ul><li>End Gateways in the Outer End will be from EE instead of BEI. Everything should still work properly though.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Progressive Bosses</b><ul><li>Extra cage placement may be a little scuffed in older versions of Progressive Bosses. Make sure you're on the latest version!</li><li><i>/end_island reset</i> command may not properly reset fight history/progress on Progressive Bosses' side of things. If you use this command, you should also run <i>/progressivebosses difficulty set <player> dragon 0</i></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Better End</b><ul><li>Since the island is smaller than in vanilla, obsidian spikes will spawn closer to the center</li><li>If any spikes are missing or you have any other issues with generation, try using the <i>/end_island reset</i> command while in the End</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Nullscape</b><ul><li>Completely compatible on 1.19+. <b>Not compatible on 1.18.2.</b></li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Savage Ender Dragon</b><ul><li>The crystals Better End Island adds in the center may rarely respawn, if crystal respawning from Savage Ender Dragon is enabled. Otherwise completely compatible.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Ender Trigon</b><ul><li>Completely compatible</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>True Ending: Ender Dragon Overhaul</b><ul><li>Lots of little incompatibilities with the dragon's new attacks, such as it pathing through the central tower and obsidian pillars. Not recommended.</li></ul></li>\n<li><b>Incompatible</b><ul><li>Stellarity</li><li>Valkyrien Skies</li></ul></li></ul>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"Play with friends with the Essential mod!\" href=\"https://essential.gg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2mVOWMC.jpeg\" alt=\"Play with friends with the Essential mod!\" /></a></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"Play with friends with the Essential mod!\" href=\"https://essential.gg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2mVOWMC.jpeg\" alt=\"Play with friends with the Essential mod!\" /></a></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

But most of all, it offers an abstraction layer for developing mods on both the Forge and Fabric mod loader, making ports and maintaining mods rather simple without having to rewrite a bunch of logic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This mod doesn't do anything on its own, so install it only when you also use another one of my mods.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Fabric version of this project additionally depends on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Forge Config API Port</strong></span></a> library. This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>",

          "body": "### Tide is a mod that aims to enhance and expand the vanilla fishing system by adding many new mechanics as well as 60+ new fish to find in your worlds!\n\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1306794817396805712?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoSize=0&label=discord&labelColor=000000&color=3067bf)](https://discord.gg/773R6cruH6)\n\n![Fishing](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/die1AF7i/images/a9fbe45347cb3830bf19e67807f4a24629cbbef9.png)\n_(See gallery for more images)_\n\n_Note: This mod requires Cloth Config_\n\n\nSpecific fish can be found in specific areas. Some fish live in freshwater rivers and lakes while some prefer the oceans. You can either find them swimming around in water, or you can catch them with a fishing rod. In addition to this, fish can be found underground, with more unique fish for different levels. These fish can be eaten, cooked, crafted into useful items, or sold to fishermen villagers.\n\nTo catch fish faster, different types of bait can be crafted, which can be applied to your fishing rod to gain unique bonuses.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sA8o7CE.png\" alt=\"Bait types\"/>\n</p>\n\nYou can craft special fishing rods using the resources you find in your world by using a smithing table, a piece of string, and either a cobblestone block, iron ingot, gold ingot, diamond, or netherite ingot. These rods have much more durability and can be made early on, so remember to craft these.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Grss5mc.png\" alt=\"Rods 1\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XPml35Q.png\" alt=\"Rods 2\"/>\n</p>\n\nTo reel in a fish, you will have to right click to time the marker with the center of the bar. If you get close enough, and the fish doesn't escape, you will catch it. If you miss, the fish will be lost.\n\nThe stronger the fish, the harder it is to catch it. Be careful!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3guonOm.png\" alt=\"Minigame 1\" width=\"420\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZtqFgX.png\" alt=\"Minigame 2\" width=\"420\"/>\n</p>\n\n---\n\nFishing rods can now be customized to add special perks and looks to any rod. This can be done by crafting an Angling Table, which will allow you to add special hooks, lines, and bobbers to fishing rods. Each upgrade has a different effect that can be added.\n\n![Angler's Workshop](https://i.imgur.com/AKgYVEq.png)\n\n---\n\nA multitude of other mechanics have been introduced, one of these being lava fishing. By using the Angler's Workshop to add a Lavaproof Fishing Hook to your rod, fishing rods can be used in all kinds of lava pools to reel in various fish and other items.\n\n![Lava Fishing](https://i.imgur.com/8bjAbXK.png)\n\n---\n\nA new item that you get from the start of the game can help keep track of the fish you have collected: the Fishing Journal. Any new fish that you catch will be added to this book where you can view their category and some information about them. The book contains many pages that help sort the fish you find into unique categories and track your progress through the mod. This book can be re-crafted with a normal book and any fish if you lose it.\n\n![Fishing Journal](https://i.imgur.com/FkYXjYa.png)\n\nIf you're up for a challenge, try getting every entry in the fishing journal. This isn't a task for the faint of heart, however, and is a huge long-term goal, requiring you to visit different biomes and dimensions and become a master of fishing.\n\n![Journal Page](https://i.imgur.com/2vUJGN7.png)\n\n---\n\nIf you're lucky, you might reel in some large crates. They can be fished up pretty much anywhere, and can be hooked more commonly with magnetic bait. They can contain fish, random resources, and sometimes treasure. Just make sure you don't lose them if they happen to sink back into the ocean.\n\n![Wooden Crate](https://i.imgur.com/IpIHnfA.png)\n\n---\n\nCompatibility included with:\n\n- **Fish of Thieves Mod**: Fish added to journal + Worms are useable as bait\n- **Nether Depths Upgrade**: Fish added to journal + lava fish can be caught with tide rods\n- **Unusual Fish Mod**: Fish added to journal\n- **Rainbow Reef**: Fish added to journal\n- **Fins and Tails** - Fish added to journal\n- **Blue Skies**: Fish added to journal\n- **Fishing Real**: Live fish variants can be pulled in\n- **Naturalist** - Caterpillars and butterflies can be used as bait\n- [Stardew Fishing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stardew-fishing): Tide minigame is replaced with stardew fishing minigame\n- [More Fishing Rod Variants](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-fishing-rod-variants) - The rods will use Tide's fishing bobber\n- **Alex's Mobs/Caves** - https://modrinth.com/datapack/alexs-mods-x-tide-compat\n- **Upgrade Aquatic, Spawn, L_Ender's Cataclysm, Deep Aether** - https://modrinth.com/datapack/tide-extra-compatibility\n\n_I wouldn't recommend using this mod with Aquaculture._\n\n\nHelp me out by letting me know about any issues with the mod or things that you would like to see added by leaving a comment or issue on the discord server/github page!\n\n![Bass](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/die1AF7i/images/b75b7e1b9fb5b739f4d1b0e353e4eb009edf11ca.png)",

          "body": "Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ",

This mod enhances the way terrain is generated and experienced by introducing custom slabs that blend seamlessly with the natural world. No more harsh, blocky steps as you traverse the environment—this mod smooths out the rough edges, allowing for a more immersive and enjoyable exploration experience.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Ground and ceiling slabs: Slabs are generated throughout the entire chunk, meaning they appear not only on the surface but also within caves, adding a more natural feel to underground exploration.\n- Variety of Materials: Slabs are created from various common blocks like dirt, grass, mycelium, moss, gravel, sand, and even special blocks like clay and deepslate. Some are affected by gravity like the blocks they are made from!\n- No Inventory Junk: Breaking these custom slabs causes them to drop the block they are made out of, so your inventory isn't full of things you don't want or need!\n- Config: Toggle slab generation in the world via embedded Midnightlib - if you only want the slabs 😉\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe slabs automatically generate in your world alongside your terrain, smoothing out the transitions between different block heights. The goal is to make exploration easier without drastically changing the vanilla Minecraft feel. It bridges the gap between blocky hills and steep cliffs, letting you run up slopes naturally.\n\n**Before:**\n![before slabs](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/26591073ddb7bc28cca65153850c1ce56cad151c.jpeg)\n**After:** \n![after slabs](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5f1dfa470e3e983523f3c7b3f01e8799ec2d9d66.jpeg)\n \n**Compatibility**\n\n- Minecraft Version: Works with Minecraft 1.21.1+\n- Mod Loader: Fabric (Currently not supported for Forge)\n- Multiplayer Support: Fully functional in multiplayer worlds.\n\n**Future Plans**\n\n- Additional Slab Types: We plan to expand the variety of slabs to include more unique terrain and biome-based blocks.\n- Customizable Generation: Config options to customize the terrain slab placement and block behavior.\n- Nether and End Generation: With Nether and End based Slabs!\n- Slab Improvements: Water running through slabs, vertical slabs, lighting fixes, vegetation growing on slabs and much more!\n- LOTS AND LOTS OF BUGFIXES 😅\n\n**Follow Countered for Updates!**\n\nStay up to date with the latest news, updates, and upcoming features for \"Countered's Terrain Slabs\" by following me on social media:\n\n- Twitter (X): https://twitter.com/RealCountered\n- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/coun7ered.bsky.social\n- Discord: (Link coming soon!)\n- YouTube: (Link coming soon!)\n- GitHub: https://github.com/Coun7ered/terrain-slabs-mod\n- Donate on PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=M6JCVGPEDKKDS\n  \n**Feedback and Support**\n\nI would love to hear your feedback on the mod! If you have suggestions, bug reports, or just want to share your experience, please create an issue or DM me on X. \n\n**Credits**\n\nThanks to demorogabrtz for translations!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Minecraft modding community for their support and resources that made this project possible. A big shoutout to everyone who tested early versions and provided feedback to improve the mod!\n\n![badlands sunset](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/786d275fad85b9380ed8b2ad705ce4572b4b1500.jpeg)",

This suits multiplayer, where multiple players are attacking, as well as modpacks with a heavy focus on attribute progression, such as any modpack with Apotheosis.\n\nThe combat module also enables the player to configure knockback, attack strength, and disabling non fully-charged attacks. \n\n\n \n## XP Module\nThe simple purpose of the XP module is to replicate a souls-like death experience (no pun intended) in Minecraft. Now upon death, you will leave an XP Catalyst behind instead of spewing only a part of their levels onto the ground. Returning to it and claiming it rewards the player with 100% of their lost XP. It will also ignore keepInventory (configurable) in order to renew the stakes of death, even with keepInventory on.\n\n\n \n## Enchanting Module\nThe Enchanting Module aims to mystify enchantments once again. Now, upon finding enchanted gear from looting any chest or killing a mob, the enchantments are hidden -- stowed away in their original language -- until they can be identified by the player.\n\nEnchanted items can be identified several ways.\n\n1. Using a Scroll of Identification over the item in your inventory (craftable)\n\n2. Equipping the item if it is armor (at your own risk)\n\n3. Right-clicking on an enchanting table with the unidentified item (configurable)\n\n\n \n## Durability Module\nThe Durability Module is a major quality of life mechanic and utility. It disables vanilla durability usage, and instead replaces that mechanic with durability loss on death of your equipped items.\n\n\n## Hunger Module\nThe Hunger Module is a major quality of life mechanic and utility. It removes vanilla hunger, instead making food directly heal you. It also offers config options over natural regeneration, food and potion stack sizes, and more!\n\n \n### Looking for a great RPG mod to use this alongside?

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Contributors\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla, Kayla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nLocalizations are kindly submitted from our community on CrowdIn.

From there, you can simply access the config through the mods menu on both platforms. For servers, edit `config/rightclickharvest.json5`.\n- **The mod isn't working.** The most common issue is that **Require Hoe** is set to `true` in the config, meaning that you have to be holding a hoe to harvest crops.\n- **Can you update to [version]?** The versions I currently support for all of my mods are documented [here](https://docs.jamalam.tech/supported-versions/). If the version you want is not listed, the answer is probably no.\n- **How do I make the mod work with crops from Supplementaries?** A compatibility mod is available: [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rightclickharvest-supplementaries-compat), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/rch-supplementaries-compat)\n- **What are the dependencies of this mod?** Architectury API and JamLib are required, as well as Fabric API on Fabric.\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">For any questions not listed above, please join the Discord by clicking on the banner below.</h3>\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Please report any bugs to the <a href=\"https://github.com/JamCoreModding/right-click-harvest\">GitHub page</a>.</h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.jamalam.tech\"><img alt=\"Join the Discord\" src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RightClickHarvest/BH_RH_BANNER3.webp\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/jamalam\"><img alt=\"Rent a Server (25% off with code JAMALAM)\" src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/RightClickHarvest/BH_RH_PROMO.webp\" /></a>\n",

This includes Biomes O Plenty, Regions Unexplored, Nature's Spirit, and more.\n\n**Terralith**\n\nTectonic has a special version with Terralith compatibility. This version is shipped in the mod version of Tectonic, but it is available as a standalone datapack [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic).\n\n**CliffTree**\n\nOn 1.20, Tectonic and Clifftree are **not** compatible.\n\nOn 1.21, Tectonic needs some small tweaks to work with CliffTree. These tweaks are shipped with the mod version of Tectonic, but they are available as a datapack [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/clifftree-tectonic).\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n## Features\n\nThe mod version of Tectonic has a config for editing many of the following features. Tectonic v3 has a config screen, making it easier than ever to know what certain fields do and to configure them in-game.\n\n---\n\n### Continents and Islands\nIn Tectonic v3, terrain forms into continent-like landmasses. Continents will generate thousands to tens of thousands of blocks wide, tailored to account for the project's massive mountain ranges and new terrain types.\n\nIn the oceans between continents you'll find relatively smaller \"islands\", ranging up to around a thousand blocks across. These islands use vanilla's mountain terrain shaping, now making it possible to find traditional mountain rings. \n\nWith Terralith installed, these islands spawn Calderas and Volcanoes!\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/822d0e20a35cedbc257742ae4a2f52b783992c2c.png)\n\n---\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer! Deep oceans in particular have more varied terrain, featuring overhangs and valleys.\n\nIf the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.\n\n---\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe biggest highlight of Tectonic's terrain is the massive mountain ranges. They can stretch for tens of thousands of blocks, going high enough to approach the build limit!\n\n![Mountain range](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/e312ff19967d89e3fd79f2d5b78270a44fb9f216.png)\n\n---\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers. These rivers vary vastly in size and shape.\n\nIf the mod version is installed, these will have increased glow lichen and rare areas with lanterns!\n\n![Underground river](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/202e23ab60b9494e4034db723900eb37acc5a60f.png)\n\n---\n\n### Lava Tunnels\n\n*Very* deep underground, you can find a deeper variant of underground rivers with different shaping and lava instead of water.\n\n![Lava tunnel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/8f348455fe615d6d7a1f727e3b6b7e10fb21c70a.png)\n\n---\n\n### Jungle Pillars\n\nSome jungles feature massive pillars that can extend upwards of a hundred blocks tall!\n\n![Jungle pillars](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/d5f4cd12359d19c318316be72a0319d6d7ebb23b.png)\n\n---\n\n### Canyons\n\nSome badlands will generate *very* large canyons, making them a spectacle to find and travel through.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/84fd0dac6cc7d2935344bc7ccdbbbe017e6b6aa8.png)\n\n---\n\n### Dunes\n\nMost deserts will generate smooth, rolling dunes.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/5cf544329f978e3db4c49eba296e1e77a787f714.png)\n\n---\n\n### Plateaus\n\nIn some areas, towering 2-3 tiered plateaus will generate. These plateaus will sometimes have smoother \"ramps\" to make exploration in survival more accessible.\n\nBadlands also feature isolated plateaus, not directly bound to nearby rivers.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/0e2d3bd5969fb17a3ec459e7717a860fce16fb37.png)\n\n---\n\n### Valleys\n\nWhile plateaus usually elevate plateau biomes, some Cherry Groves and Pale Gardens have the plateaus surround the biome, turning the biome into a valley.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/39542628a574d52271c31f70645f8fdda381fa83.png)\n\n---\n\n### Wetlands\n\nSome forest, jungle and taiga biomes generate very close to sea level and generate frequent ponds and lakes.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/13a3c19f29d1593a4c75c4ad37976a3aa1cc0b01.png)\n\n---\n",

          "body": "# Welcome to William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld for 1.20.1 and higher!\n\n![William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54945257/205379797-def647a9-8d28-4c90-80b9-08d8a4a0e082.png)\n\n## Introduction\nThis mod attempts to recreate the familiar landscapes you know and love in a way that creates a more realistic and atmospheric world.\n\n# Where is WWOO (WWOO/WWEE difference)?\nWe decided to split WWOO in two distinct mods:\n- **Expanded Ecosphere**: This mod includes new biomes and builds upon the old 1.19/1.20 WWOO (bad compatibility with other world-gen mods).\n- **WWOO**: This new project is focused on overhauling the vanilla biomes and is inspired by the style of the old 1.16/1.17 WWOO (good compatibility with other world-gen mods).\n\n## Key Features\n### Overhauled Biomes\nEvery biome has been reworked to provide a more realistic and immersive environment. Say goodbye to the standard biomes and welcome an enhanced world filled with diverse landscapes and exciting adventures.\n\nFor an extensive showcase of the (sub)biomes, join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x) and check out [this channel](https://discord.com/channels/779938168573132801/1381410007035150497) (1.21.5+).\n\n### Biome Transitions\nDiscover the new transitions between biomes, that eliminate jarring shifts between environments, allowing for a more natural world flow. Check out this [example picture](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/II7t6llZ/images/415ed50637330b1c39d463076af7f2ab5fe9a283.png) in the Gallery.\n\n### Compatibility with Vanilla Clients\nWorried about compatibility issues with your friends? Fear not! Overhauled Overworld exclusively uses vanilla blocks, ensuring that you can install this mod on your server, and your friends can join with their vanilla clients. This makes for a hassle-free and enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n## Enhance Your Experience\n- **Navigable Rivers**: Improve your river experience with this travel-friendly add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/navigable-rivers-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Cliffs and Coves**: Improve your world with better coastlines using this add-on. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/cliffs-and-coves-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-2/)\n\n- **Towering Tepuis**: Add a forbidding and mysterious area of adventure to your world. [Download Here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towering-tepuis-for-overhauled-overworld-1-20-4-1-20-6/)\n\nIf you prefer a datapack over a mod, click [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/4pbhwMQz) to download the datapack version of WWOO.\n\n\n## Join Our Community\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect with fellow adventurers, we invite you to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yJng7sC44x). While there's no Wiki available yet, our friendly community is always ready to assist you on your journey through the Overhauled Overworld.",

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

I've bundled them in this mod.</p>\n<p>This mod adds a bunch of optional tweaks to improve the Quality of Life during gameplay. Tweaks can be individually enabled or disabled and configured. Many of the tweaks are disabled by default, so make sure to enable the features you want for the most bestest experience possible.</p>\n<p>This mod is available for NeoForge, Fabric and Forge. It requires <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/balm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Balm</a>, which must be installed alongside the mod.</p>\n<h3><img src=\"https://mods.twelveiterations.com/img/features-header.png\" alt=\"Features\" width=\"836\" height=\"40\"></h3>\n<h3>No Offhand Torch With Block</h3>\n<p>This option will refuse to place a torch if you're holding a block in your main hand. Because there's no way you intended to place a torch in that case. Something was just standing in the way of the spot you wanted to place that block in but the torch was fitting since it's smaller. Fixed it for ya.</p>\n<h3>No Offhand Torch With Empty Hand</h3>\n<p>You know that feeling when you're tired, try to open the chest but misclicked the block next to it? And of course you still had a torch in your offhand. And of course it placed it. And now you have to break it again. Ugh. This option only allows torches to be placed when your main hand is not empty. This can be enabled additionally to the above.</p>\n<h3>No Offhand Torch With Food</h3>\n<p>This option prevents you from placing a torch from your offhand when you have food in your hand.</p>\n<h3>No Offhand Torch At All</h3>\n<p>This option completely disables placing torches from your offhand. Useful if you only carry a torch in your offhand for things like dynamic lighting.</p>\n<h3>Offhand Torch With Tools Only</h3>\n<p>This is the option I consider best, but it changes vanilla behaviour too much to be the default. This will only allow placing torches from the offhand when you're holding a tool. No more accidental torch placement, ever again.</p>\n<h3>Do Not Use Last Torch</h3>\n<p>This option is useful when using dynamic lights such as OptiFine. The last torch in your offhand will not be placeable, so you always have a light to carry around with you secured.</p>\n<h3>No Offhand Fireworks with Elytra while Grounded</h3>\n<p>This option prevents you from shooting fireworks when you're wearing an Elytra and not currently flying.</p>\n<h3>Hide Own Effect Particles</h3>\n<p>This option will make your own potion effect particles a lot less obtrusive for your client. Other players will see them normally. No more annoying particles blocking your view.</p>\n<h3>Hide Offhand Item</h3>\n<p>Will prevent the item in your offhand from rendering, in case you hate seeing the torch you're carrying on the left. This can be toggled by a keybind too, in case you only hate seeing your offhand item sometimes.</p>\n<h3>Hide Shield Unless Holding Weapon</h3>\n<p>Will prevent shields from being rendered in your offhand unless you're holding a weapon. Specifically, it needs to be a sword or an axe with an attack damage value greater than 1.5 hearts. No, that wooden stick you're holding isn't a weapon.</p>\n<h3>Auto Climb Ladder</h3>\n<p>I often make really long ladders down to my mine, and it's a pain having to hold down a key the whole time while climbing back up. With this tweak on, you will continue to climb upwards as long as you look upwards while on a ladder. That means you can type in chat and do other things without instantly falling back down and losing all of your progress on the long journey.</p>\n<h3>Disable Potion Shift</h3>\n<p>Prevents the inventory from being shifted to the right when potion effects are active. You probably never noticed because NEI did it in 1.7.10 and now Quark does it in 1.10.2 and then there's also a mod called No Potion Shift that does it, but in case you have none of these, you now have this!</p>\n<h3>Toggle Log Stripping</h3>\n<p>This option adds a keybind that lets you toggle the ability to strip logs. Useful when you build using wood and have an axe-like tool in your hand a lot to prevent accidental strippings.</p>\n<h3>Toggle Off Step Assist</h3>\n<p>There's people who hate step assist, but sometimes those step-assist granting items add some other cool perks that we want. So this option lets you disable the step-assist part only. With optional keybind to toggle.</p>\n<h3>Master Volume Slider in Options Screen</h3>\n<p>Yes, the new volume settings screen is cool. But couldn't you have kept the Master Volume slider on the main settings screen as well? After years of research I have concluded that you can, so I added it back. Saved you a click.</p>\n<h3>Music Volume Slider in Options Screen</h3>\n<p>Made up user studies have shown that the average player will much more frequently want to turn off the music than change the master volume, so our team of highly experienced quantum programmers have also brought the music slider back to the main settings screen</p>\n<h3>Pane Building Support</h3>\n<p>This option increases the hitbox of iron fences and glass panes when you're holding a matching block, making it easier to place them against each other.</p>\n<h3>Chain Building Support</h3>\n<p>This option increases the hitbox of chains when you're holding a chain block, making it easier to place them against each other.</p>\n<h3>Creative Breaking Support</h3>\n<p>This option will increase the hitbox of random-offset blocks in creative mode, making it easier to break them quickly.</p>\n<h3>Prevent Accidental Mining</h3>\n<p>This option will prevent the accidental mining of certain fragile blocks like budding amethysts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/73/708/2016-09-26_03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\"></p>",

          "body": "# Passable Foliage 🌳\n\nThis mod removes collision from leaves and reduces the damage when falling into leaves. This can be applied to all entities or only to players.\n\nVery helpful when you are riding through a forest.\n\nThere is also a new enchantment that makes you able to climb and stand on the leaves. (Fabric 1.19~1.20: the recipe of enchanted book requires Lychee mod to be installed)\n\n### Technical information\n\nThere is a block tag that controls whether a block is passable. So you can customize everything yourself.\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods? BisectHosting is the perfect solution.

And it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n[![Available on Fabric](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/513035d1231a86dff137c74e04a5e64633593f10.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions?l=fabric)\n[![Available on Quilt](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/a9ee492fd1a5fcbcc14d4105aa27be63f2518529.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions?l=quilt)\n[![Available on NeoForge](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b9ae07fbc26c08220b4856cb244f86904d0c172c.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions?l=neoforge)\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only provide official support for graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.5 or newer. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years will meet these requirements, including the following:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n\n**Nearly all graphics cards that are already compatible with Minecraft (which requires OpenGL 3.3) should also work with Sodium.** But our team cannot ensure compatibility or provide support for older graphics cards, and they may not work with future versions of Sodium.\n\n**If you are running into problems, you should [make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility).** Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\nAndroid devices (and some Windows-on-ARM devices) which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, GLonD3D12 etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n---\n\n_**Note:** The level of performance you see while using the Sodium mod will vary depending on exact hardware and software configuration. For all performance comparisons provided on this page, we used a computer with integrated graphics which we believe to be representative of the casual player._\n\n<sup>_**Hardware configuration:** Intel Core i7-1165G7 (4c/8t, up to 4.70 GHz) with Intel Xe Graphics (96 EUs, up to 1.30 GHz), 2x16 GB DDR4-3200._</sup>\n<sup>_**Software configuration:** Fedora 41, Linux 6.12.4, Mesa 24.3.4, Prism Launcher 9.1, OpenJDK 21.0.7 runtime (as packaged by distribution), Fabric Loader 0.16.10._</sup>",

For example, you can add an option page to Embeddium on Forge, Fabric Sodium 0.5 on 1.20.1, and Fabric/NeoForge Sodium 0.6 on 1.21.1 with one event:\n\n\n```\nOptionGUIConstruction.EVENT.register((pages) -> pages.add(new TestOptionPage()));\n```\n\nIf you're an end user, and you don't have this mod installed already as a library for another Sodium addon, you can install it alongside Reese's Options to get improved category menu, with drop-down support so that it's easier to navigate. This will take effect even for mods that don't use this API and inject into Sodium options directly.\n\n![demo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/3768c862c279cb47278855c2d99aeb568e68573b_0.webp)\n\nThis mod is partially a fork of the Embeddium categories API and options events, with heavy changes to support upstream Sodium. While it makes changes to the Reese's Sodium Options menu, it does so via mixin for compatibility reasons, so you will need to install both.\n\n## Using the API\n\nFirst, you will need to add this mod to your dev environment, using the Maven release for Curseforge or Modrinth.\n\n```\nmodImplementation(\"maven.modrinth:sodium-options-api:version\")\n```\n\nThen, this mod provides three events in `toni.sodiumoptionsapi.api`:\n\n- `OptionGUIConstruction.EVENT`, called once in the GUI constructor, allows adding entire pages. This is probably the one you want.\n- `OptionPageConstruction.EVENT`, called for each OptionPage. Use this if you want to add a group of toggles to the performance tab or something.\n- `OptionGroupConstruction.EVENT`, called for each group of options. Use this if you want to insert a single option into an existing group, or modify the vanilla ones.",

SCROLL DOWN TO FIND IT.```\n\n# About The Shader\nI liked chocapic13's v9, but i could not be satisfied. I went from changing shader settings to adding shader settings. Eventually i decided i wanted to try and bring out my own visual taste in the shader. So here i am, with a pretty sizeable edit of chocapic13's shaders.\n\n# Requirements\n- AMD graphics card\n- Nvidia graphics card\n- Apple Devices or Intel Integrated Graphics are low priority. USE IRIS FOR BEST RESULTS\n- Optifine or Iris. Oculus might work but i will not give it attention. \n- Designed for Minecraft versions 1.17 +\n- Mod support is not going to happen unless i need to make minimal changes for it to work.\n\n# Questions? Bugs? Want to help test In-development versions?\n- [Contact me on my Discord server](https://discord.gg/8nVt56H9zH)\n- [Alternatively, contact me on the ShaderLabs Discord, in the Bliss Channel](https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S)\n- [Test in-development versions here (there is a guide in the README)](https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader)\n- [Report a bug, request a feature, or ask a question here](https://github.com/X0nk/Bliss-Shader/issues/new/choose)\n- [Want to support me? Throw money at me here](https://ko-fi.com/xonkdev)\n\n### This shader is an edit of Chocapic13's V9 medium, and uses code from other Chocapic13 v9 versions. [The original shader can be found here ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders)",

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Choose Your Style\nComplementary Shaders comes with two distinct visual style options. The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after you download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks. (Choose Iris if you are unsure)\n<br>\n**-** Then you need to launch the game, and get to the Shaderpacks/Shaders menu in Video Settings.\n<br>\n**-** Open the shaderpacks folder by clicking the button in the menu.\n<br>\n**-** Download Complementary Shaders and put it in the shaderpacks folder. (Please don't unzip the file)\n<br>\n**-** Get back in the game, and choose Complementary in the shaderpacks menu. (Refresh the menu if it doesn't appear)\n\n<br>\n\n### Other\n**-** Check out the [**Complementary Development Website**](https://www.complementary.dev/) for more information.\n<br>\n**-** Join the [**Complementary Discord**](https://discord.gg/ck5htDSQPv) community if you have any questions, or just want to talk.\n<br>\n**-** If you would like to support the development of Complementary, you can do so on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/emingt).",

Took me a while to match some of the unique looks the SEUS version had but I eventually figured it out.\nPlease note that this pack does **not** perform better than SEUS v10.1 with the default settings due to many new effects that didn't exist in that version, like volumetric clouds and fog. With the correct settings however it is able to outperform it by a lot while producing much better visuals.\nIt is also important to note that this pack does **not** use any code from SEUS v10.1.\n\n## **What features does it offer?**\n* atmospheric sky\n* volumetric fog\n* volumetric clouds\n* dynamic shadows\n* soft shadows\n* screen-space raytraced ambient occlusion (RTAO)\n* water volume\n* dimension support\n* wind effects\n* temporal anti-aliasing and upscaling (TAAU)\n* motionblur\n* bloom\n\n## **Any Requirements?**\n* Optifine for 1.16 or newer/Iris 1.5.0 or newer\n* GTX 1050/RX 560 or similar/better (has to support OpenGL 4.0)\n  * something faster is generally recommended though\n* Windows/Linux\n* **DUE TO REPEATED ISSUE-REPORTS: Intel HD 5000 Graphics and older are NOT supported!**\n\n## **External Links:**\n* My Website: [Link](https://rre36.com/vanilla-plus)\n* My Discord Server: [Link](https://discord.gg/y5xzQ6H)\n\n[![Become a Patron](https://rre36.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Patreon_ForEmbed.png)](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=19790203)",

For modpack creators, I suggest looking into Triumph if you are creating a pack with custom advancements.\n\nIn the future it'll also contain extra features for modders to use, if you are a modder and have a request feel free to make an issue on the tracker.\n\nIf you aren't a modder, but have a feature request. Whether it is a visual or functional tweak, feel free to make an issue as well.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Screen filling UI (instead of the tiny one used by ants) ([Examples](https://imgur.com/a/gnb1m))\n- Change the color of the advancement icons (instead of the default gray, blue and orange)\n- Adds setting to stop fading of the advancements background on hover\n- Description boxes can grow slightly larger, so they are easier to read\n- Adds title of tab to title of advancements UI\n \n\nAlso available for Fabric for 1.18.2+",

In addition, it offers a similar overlay for clocks, showing the time of day.\n\n## Coordinate Overlays\n\nCoordinate overlays for the player's X and Z coordinates are visible whenever the player has a compass in their inventory, including in a bundle.\n\nIn 1.21.6 and above, the Player Locator Bar also requires a compass. This can be disabled in the config.\n\nWhen a player additionally has an item that displays depth, like a [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries) Altimeter or a Depth Gauge from mods like [Caverns & Chasms](https://modrinth.com/mod/caverns-and-chasms) or [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery), the Y coordinate value is shown as well. If no item is available, a compass item is sufficient to show the overlay.\n\n## Time and Weather Overlays\n\nAn overlay displaying the current time of day is displayed whenever the player has a clock in their inventory, including in a bundle.\n\nWhen a player additionally has an item that displays the weather, like a [Caverns & Chasms](https://modrinth.com/mod/caverns-and-chasms) Barometer, the weather is shown as well. If no item is available, a clock item is sufficient to show the overlay.\n\n## Mod Compatibility\n\nThe mod has support for [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery), [Caverns & Chasms](https://modrinth.com/mod/caverns-and-chasms), and [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries) items out of the box. For other mods, items can be added to the mod's various config options.\n\nIn addition, the following features are present when compatible mods are installed:\n- [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories): Items with overlays will work in accessory slots.\n- [Accessorify](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessorify): This mod's overlays will replace the ones from Accessorify.\n- [Player Locator Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/player-locator-plus): The locator bar is now only displayed when the player has a compass.\n- [Better Player Locator Bar](https://modrinth.com/mod/bplb): The locator bar is now only displayed when the player has a compass.\n- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap): When a map item is set, it can be used inside a bundle.\n- [Map Atlases](https://modrinth.com/mod/map-atlases) (disabled by default, has issues): Atlases can be used inside a bundle.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe concept for this mod came from a prototype by [nöelle](https://modrinth.com/user/noelledotjpg) for Raspberry Flavoured. I took this concept and iterated on it in my mod, [Raspberry Core](https://modrinth.com/mod/raspberry-core), before finalizing it here as Immersive Overlays.\n\nTextures and mod icon are also by [nöelle](https://modrinth.com/user/noelledotjpg).",

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)",

Here is your chance!\n------------------\n[![Modloader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loader-Fabric%20|%20Forge-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://fabricmc.net)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/973561601519149057.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KN9b3pjFTM)\n\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🧶️ Features\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Adds Combat Roll ability\nPress `R` to roll (by default). You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.",

So no classic 4 element schools are implemented, besides fire.)\n\nThe library offers an API to query spell damage of an entity (based on its attributes, status effects, enchantments), and provides critical strike chance and multiplier. Critical striking is completely rng based, powered by secondary attributes.\n\n## 📦 Content\n\n### Entity Attributes:\n\n- Spell Power, one for each specific magic school (for example: `spell_power:fire`)\n- Spell critical chance (id: `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n- Spell critical damage (id: `spell_power:critical_damage`)\n- Spell haste (id: `spell_power:haste`), can be used to quicken spell casting or cooldowns\n\n### Status Effects:\n\n- One specifically for each introduced attribute, with a matching id (for example: `spell_power:fire`, `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n\n(All status effects come with fancy icons 😍)\n\n### Enchantments:\n\n- Universal Spell Power (named: \"Spell Power\"), increasing all spell damage\n- School limited Spell Power (for example: \"Sunfire\", increasing arcane and fire damage) \n- Secondary attribute enchantments (for example: \"Spell Critical Chance\")\n- \"Magic Protection\" (totally symmetric to Projectile Protection, but for magic)\n\n(All enchantments are fully configurable, and come with descriptions)\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.\n",

          "body": "This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.",

It also allows you to change your skin **without leaving the server** as long as the mod is installed on the server.\n\n*SkinShuffle integrates with Mojang's online API to change skins, if you do not have a Minecraft account, SkinShuffle WILL NOT work, you will receive NO SUPPORT from me for using a pirated version of Minecraft.*\n\nSkins are stored in Skin Presets, these presets can be created from the following sources:\n\n- Texture URLs \n- Usernames\n- UUIDs\n- Files\n- In-game textures (Resource Locations)\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CNMASU7GQBs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"server-side-support\">Server-Side Support</h2>\n\nWhen SkinShuffle is installed on the server, you can change your skin in-game without having to relog. SkinShuffle will refresh your skin for you, and for other players instantly - even for players that do not have the mod on their client.\n\n**Got a Paper/Spigot/Bukkit server?** Consider using the [Skin Shuffle Bridge plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/skinshuffle-bridge) to allow players on your server to hot-swap skins!\n\nAlternatively, SkinShuffle is supported by [SkinRestorer (fabric+neoforge+forge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinrestorer) if your server has that installed, players using SkinShuffle will be able to quickly change their skins without needing to rejoin!\n\nWe have massive plans to expand server-side support in the future:\n\n- Skin Changing Commands that allow vanilla clients to change their skins.\n- Skin Preset Sharing\n\n<h2 id=\"client-side-support\">Client-Side Support</h2>\n\nSkinShuffle works right out the bat for clients! Browse, create and edit skin presets in the Carousel and Edit Preset screens that can be accessed via Mod Menu or through the widget on the pause screen and the title screen.\n\nWhen you start the game for the first time with SkinShuffle, it will automatically create a preset from your current skin and set it as the main preset! Your currently chosen preset will be shown on the widget.\n\n<center><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/0b5e81688937e2685b2fa00ec709c5c1db302648.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/e13b4fcd7b37d02aa043e422d2e9560d6f099527.png\"></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"carousel-screen\">Carousel Screen</h2>\n\nThe carousel is where all your skins will be stored for future use! You can create, edit and delete your presets.\n  \nThe carousel screen has two modes: Compact and Carousel\n\nYou can customize every preset to your own desire in the edit screen.\n<br><br>\n<center><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/ced596ec493eff53b3be5139fc991cf1e4d18d16.png\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/fea4801fa0923716a06982652c23c9a5c3fc72cf.png\"></center>\n\n<h3 id=\"edit-screen\">Edit Screen</h2>\n\nThe edit screen allows you to change the actual texture of the skin, the model type and the name of the preset.\n\nFor the future, there are plans to add cape and ear customization to this screen.\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/e36d3d61b107d22fba09831bd06bb80de0474921.png\" />\n</center>\n\n<h3 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\n\nEvery part of SkinShuffle is customizable thanks to [YACL]()'s powerful configuration screen.\n\nYou can customize the speed that skins rotate in the carousel, to where they should follow your cursor, and where the preview widget should show.\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3s19I5jr/images/d1f435ad282114885fd9b589c538c8e7250b39ac.png\" />\n</center>\n\n<small>\n\nBy using my mods, you agree to the [Modpack Distribution Guidelines](https://imb11.dev/legal/modpacks) and the [End User License Agreement](https://imb11.dev/legal/eula)\n\n</small>\n",

Simple, just craft a lantern and crouch-right-click to equip to your Accessories slot! The lantern will dangle from your belt and light up the area around you. When you move around in game, the lantern will swing around like a pendulum in third person.\n\nThere are a couple mods that add dynamic lighting support to lanterns in a similar way, but Immersive Lanterns is the first to feature full compatibility with Iris shaderpacks that have their own custom dynamic lighting. For example, if you equip a Soul Lantern and use Complementary, you'll get blue lighting!\n\nImmersive Lanterns is available for 1.20.1 and 1.21.1+ on Forge and Fabric. On all platforms, it depends on Accessories and Sodium/Embeddium Dynamic Lights.\n",

This is probably in your modpack as a dependency for another mod.\n\nIf you are a developer, hello! This library is specifically designed to work alongside my [multiversion template mod](https://template.txni.dev/) which I use to release mods simultaneously on 1.20 & 1.21 on Forge & Fabric, from one codebase. Besides random stuff I find useful, this mod mostly contains platform and version specific implementations to cut down on the amount of repeated if/else when maintaining projects across versions. You're welcome to use it, but documentation is provided on a when-I-have-extra-time basis.",

The blog post can be found [here](https://dacubeking.com/2024/02/28/Proxying-Minecraft.html).\n\n## Configuring Cloudflared\nYou need to set up cloudflare on your server for this to work. There's plenty of guides on how to do this elsewhere.  \nMake sure in your config file (possibly in `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`) you have the lines:\n```YML\n- hostname: example.domain.net\n  service: tcp://localhost:25565\n```\nReplace `example.domain.net` with the correct subdomain you want to use. If you're running multiple instances (eg. with docker), change the port 25565 to whatever port you're using.  \nRestart the cloudflare daemon (`sudo systemctl restart cloudflared`) to apply the changes.\nAdd the correct DNS entry: go to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.net), go to your website and DNS entries, then add a new CNAME DNS entry with your subdomain and set the target to `<tunnelID>.cfargotunnel.com`, with the tunnel ID found in the cloudflare config.yml file.\n### Example DNS Entries\n![Example CNAME](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HttpRafa/modflared/multi/latest/.github/images/dns_cname.png)\n![Example TXT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HttpRafa/modflared/multi/latest/.github/images/dns_txt.png)\n\n### For Players\nIf your server admin has properly configured their server you should be able to connect to the server as usual. \nNo extra configuration is needed.\n\nIf your server admin has not properly configured their server, you will need to add their server to the `forced_tunnels.json` file in the modflared config folder. \n#### Example configuration (modflared/forced_tunnels.json)\n```JSON\n[\"example.domain.net\", \"example2.domain.net\"]\n```\n\n### Server Admins (Setting Up cloudflared)\nInstall Cloudflared as described in the “Configuring Cloudflared” part above.\n\n#### Telling modflared to use connect to your server using cloudflared\nFor the hostname that you want your players to connect to (eg. `example.domain.net`), create a TXT dns record with either of the following values:\n- `cloudflared-use-tunnel` - This will make modflared connect to the tunnel on the hostname itself (eg. `example.domain.net`)\n- `cloudflared-route=<route>` - This will make modflared connect to the tunnel under the hostname of `<route>`. \n(ex. setting `cloudflared-route=example2.domain.net` will make modflared connect to the tunnel on `example2.domain.net` instead of `example.domain.net`)",

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha. Things may change, break, crash or otherwise go wrong. You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: MC 1.20.6 and newer - NeoForge and Fabric are both in the same jar. <br>\nMC 1.20.4 and older - Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes\n\n**client side only:** <br>\nIf you only have DH installed on your client LODs will be saved between sessions, although you have to explore the world to load them.\n <br>\n**Server and Client:** <br>\nIf DH is installed on the server and client, LODs will automatically be sent to each connected user that has DH installed and has `Distant Generation Enabled` set to true, disabling distant generation on the server will prevent LODs from being sent to the users.\n\n**Q: Where can I download the Bukkit plugin?** <br>\nA: The bukkit plugin for 2.3.0 is available as an additional file in the download page.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/wikis/1-user-guide/1-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/wikis/1-user-guide/1-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/wikis/1-user-guide/1-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons",

Finally you can build the castle of your dreams without limits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Please note that for technical reasons when installing the Diagonal Walls mod walls are no longer able to connect upwards and will once again show gaps when stacked vertically (like they used to in Minecraft 1.15.2 and before). Adding that feature back is unfortunatly not technically feasible and is not planned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Blocks added by other mods are dynamically supported whenever possible.

If it crashes / doesn't load up on NeoForge, please open an issue on GitHub\n\n## Mod Features\nMost of the mods features:\n\n### Vertical Slabs variants of all vanilla slabs\nFor now, the mod only adds vertical slabs for all vanilla slabs\n\n### Crafting\nVertical slabs are crafted in a crafting table the same way as vanilla slabs but vertically.\nSome stone vertical slabs can also be crafted in a Stonecutter\n\n### Placing\nTo place a vertical slab, you need to craft one, this mod uses a seperate item for vertical slabs. You can combine vertical slabs in the same way vanilla slabs can be combined\n\n### Other\n- Vertical slabs can now be used as furnace fuel\n- Wooden Vertical slabs are flammable, be careful with fire!\n- Copper vertical slabs can be waxed and oxidise, just like other copper blocks\n\n## Translators\nHuge thanks to the following people for translating Enchanted Vertical Slabs!\n- ChristosMaragkos (github) [el_gr]\n- CANALETA (github) [es_mx]\n- PlayboyX312 (github) [ru_ru]\n- hhhhh-ckr (github) [tr_tr]\n- VladAndreiMorariu (github) [it_it]\n- ivan.hd (discord) [pt_br]\n- unroman (github) [uk_ua]\n\n## License\n<p xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" >Enchanted Vertical Slabs by <a rel=\"cc:attributionURL dct:creator\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" href=\"https://enchanted.games\">ioblackshaw (a.k.a.

It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/",

The mod late game should feel like vanilla but with added benefits\n\n> The mod is highly configurable. Just want the hammocks with no sleeping changes? You can do just that!\n<hr>\n\n### 🛏 Night Bags 🛏\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/dee42b5dd4643454e75db0a987a810bb31330bed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"197\">\n\n- A late game item crafted with echo shards and phantom membrane\n- Serves as a temporary bed that does not set your spawn point\n- When used will immediately place the player in sleep mode on the spot\n- Upon waking up they will go back in your inventory. Perfect for camping!\n- Does not prevent Phantom spawn nor provide any benefit\n\n<hr>\n\n### 💤Hammocks💤\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/ce174aba2c57bc4ef7edb6632d848d1510f542c9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"178\">\n\n- Allow players to rest during the day\n- When laying on one you can swing back and forth by pressing \"a\" or \"d\" movement keys\n- Come in all different colors\n- Can be attached to either 2 fences with 2 blocks in between or in a 3 block space against 2 blocks\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🪳Bedbugs🪳\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/7406d71aaed17430f670c918555400a55bfbc804.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"184\">\n\n- A disruptive mob that has a rare chance to spawn right after you sleep in a bed on high difficulties\n- Normally they ignore the player and sprint toward any bed close by\n- Once they reach a bed they will burrow in it making it unusable/\"infested\"\n- To solve this you'll have to use a potion of harming on the bed itself\n- Can pass through doors\n- Can also rarely spawn in the wild and will attack players when no beds are in sight\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🏠Home Bed🏠\n\n- Sleeping at least 8 times in the same bed will mark it as your \"home bed\"\n- Once a bed gets marked you'll receive a new effect, Invigorated, upon waking up\n- Invigorating increases xp drop from ores and mobs for a long period of time making it a valuable reward for committing to the same bed\n- Be sure not to break or let your bed be infested as doing so will reset its home bed status\n- Sleeping even more nights on the same bed will increase the Home Bed level even further up to a max of 100\n- Home bed status can be viewed in a newly added icon in the sleep screen\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🌒Nightmares🌒\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/e0ec71bed38bc049d458bf7249f26d4fb49f3e84.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"231\">\n\n- You can now lay on a bed or hammock without sleeping. This allows you to move your camera and access your inventory like normal\n- Successuflly sleeping will now have a cooldown. By default this will be 5m but some events, such as sleep encounters or nightmares will inflict much harsher penalties\n- You can view your current cooldown in a newly added status bar right below your crossair when aiming or resting on a bed\n- While sleeping you will see the current time on the left corner of your screen\n- Beds will no longer violently explode when in the nether. They will instead only make a tiny blast. You can also disable the explosion entirely allowing you to sleep there\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🧟Sleep Encounters🧟\n\n- Formerly known as \"bad dreams\" this is an old mechanic that was removed in previous versions of mc\n- When sleeping next to a dark spot you'll have a chance to get woken up by a mob that could have naturally spawned there\n- No longer are you safe to sleep in a dark cave!\n\n<hr>\n\n### 😪Sleep Benefits & Requirements😪\n\nThe mod offers many ways to customize your sleeping experience. Here are all the options that it offers with their default behavior\n\n- Sleeping requires full hunger (default off)\n- Sleeping requires an xp toll (default 0)\n- Sleeping will grant a status effect (Invigorating only for home beds as explained above)\n- Heal when woken up (default on)\n- Clear all effects when woken up (default on)\n- Consumes hunger when woken up (default on)\n\nAll these can be turned on or off individually for each bed type (bed, hammocks and sleeping bags)\n\nThe rest of the mod is equally configurable so be sure to check the configs for a more in depth explanation\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n\n## 💜Mod Integration💜\n</center>\n\nWhen Heartstones mod is installed sleeping next to a Heartstone owner will grant both of you a regeneration effect\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓Q&A❓\n</center>\n\nQ: This mod seems tedious. I just want hammocks and my op beds back\n> A: Just turn off all the difficulty features in the configs. The mod is entirely customizable\n\nQ: How do i get rid of bed bugs?\n> A: You'll have to account for that, hunting for them when you wake up if you hear one. Smart house construction can also help\n\nQ: I dont like X feature, how do i change it?\n> A: Everything is extremely customizable in the mods configs. Infact mod also contains some optional features off by default\n\nQ: Does this work for multiplayer?\n> A: Yes! Some features like nightmares will account for all the players nightmare change and a \"nightmare night\" will be rolled accordingly. Only the player that actually got a nightmare will be set on cooldown\n\nQ: Why does this mod nerf bed in early game?\n> A: Because being able to skip the only part of a day where mobs spawn above ground without consequences in a game built around surviving mobs seems pretty op to me. In vanilla sleeping becomes such a no brainer that you have no incentive in not doing it as soon as you can every night.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

          "body": "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://imgur.com/4IBZaA4.png\"/></p>\n \n### 💧 1.3.0 Update \n- 1.20.1 is now supported (thanks to [mlus233](https://github.com/mlus-asuka))\n- **Fire protection** and **fire resistance** slow down dehydration\n- You can **find** various **drinks** in structures' chests \n- Piglins now trade **Purified Water**\n- The Sand Filter now has a **Ponder** scene\n\n**Thirst was Taken** is a simple mod that adds a thirst mechanic to the game, but that fits well in modpacks (especially aesthetics-oriented ones) by adding diverse features and compatibility with a lot of often-used mods.  \n\n### 💧 Water Purity  \nWater can have 4 different levels of purity, depending on where it was harvested:  \n![](https://imgur.com/9HA6FXF.png)  \n\nIf you **drink non-purified water**, depending on the purity level, you will have a chance to get **sick**, or worse, **poisoned**.\n\nWater can be **purified** on a **campfire** or a **furnace**: a campfire will purify it by 1 unit, and a furnace by 2 (meaning it will go from Dirty to Acceptable, for instance).  \n\n![](https://imgur.com/Ekh8huc.png)\n\n### ☀ Climate & Cold Sweat  \n\nThe **hydration depletion** speed is **biome-dependent**, meaning you will get thirsty more easily in **hot** or **dry** biomes, and less so in **cold** or **wet** ones. Hydration is more relevant than temperature, so building your base in wet biomes is more advisable than doing so in cold ones.\nThis system is also compatible with **Cold Sweat**, and will use their more precise temperature calculations if the mod is present in the pack.  \n\n### 🍖 Farmer's Delight & Co.  \n\nThe stack size for **water bottles** has been increased to **64**, to make them fit with the foods from Farmer's Delight.\nEvery food item that should quench your thirst added by farmer's delight, respite, and brewin and chewin' is integrated by default, making teas (or booze) the **best late-game hydration source**.  \n\n### ⚙ Create\n\nA new block is added if you have Create installed: the **Sand Filter**, which can purify water fed to it by pipes.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UdIApb3.png)  \n\n### 💧 Apple Skin  \n\nThe mod is compatible with apple skin, showing the \"quenched\" overlay if the mod is present, as well as tooltips for every item that quenches your thirst.  \n\n![](https://imgur.com/pbqR6Ea.png)\n\n##### To learn more about the mod, you can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ghen-git/Thirst-Mod/wiki) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wqfgcZCfYh)\n\n##### This mod is still very early in development, which means it's filled to the brim with bugs and glitches. Sorry\n\n",

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a Minecraft server?

Storage Drawers borrows ideas from Jabba and Bibliocraft, resulting in a highly functional, compact, and aesthetic storage solution that is meant to complement rather than replace those mods.\n\nUsage\n\nThere is no traditional slotted inventory with these containers. Interaction is click-based similar to Jabba. Clicking on one of drawers on front will interact with that drawer.\n\n* Right-Click: Insert full stack in hand into drawer (or partial stack if the drawer fills).\n* Double-Right-Click: Insert all compatible stacks in inventory into drawer (or until drawer fills).\n* Left-Click: Remove a single item from the drawer.\n* Shift+Left-Click: Remove a full stack from the drawer.\n* Shift+Right-Click with empty hand: Open a UI to see exact item counts and manage applied upgrades.\n\nThe shift-click behavior is reversed from Jabba. This is based on the theory that you normally interact with stacks in Jabba, but will want to normally interact with single items in Storage Drawers. The controls can be reversed in the mod config to match Jabba.",
